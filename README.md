### The Package
You will likely have executed a `git clone` on this package from https://github.com/paulyd82/HSBC/tree/main. Some assumptions for this project:

- The user is on a Linux server with q installed.
- The package, once cloned, may be named "HSBC-main". Please rename it to HSBC
```bash
mv HSBC-main HSBC
```
- The repository has been cloned into the home/root directory of your user/appuser. Files are loaded based on this location i.e. sourced from `~/HSBC/..`. If the package does not reside here then please move it to the `~/` directory. 
```bash
mv HSBC ~/.
```

### Start-up

#### Start q process for Tasks 1 and 2
Once the package is ready in the correct location you can then run the following command to start the q process. On start-up it automatically loads the CSV files and q functions from the package:

```bash
q ~/HSBC/q/vwap_funcs.q
```

Successful start-up should be illustrated with the following example messages logged to your q session (note the counts may differ, but should be > 0):

```q
"Loading CSV file ~/HSBC/data/fx_data.csv"
"CSV file successfully loaded. Count 150"
"Loading CSV file ~/HSBC/data/clientorders_data.csv"
"CSV file successfully loaded. Count 75"
"Loading CSV file ~/HSBC/data/markettrades_data.csv"
"CSV file successfully loaded. Count 50"
```
Upon loading, the 3 tables associated with these tasks should subsequently be available for inspection as part of assessment:

```q 
select from fx
select from clientorders
select from markettrades
```

The function to load the CSVs is error trapped and the logged error should be intuitively handled by the user.

#### Task 1 Execution

VWAP

- Function call format:
```q 
calcVWAP[fx;s;st;et]

// fx: the name of the pre-loaded table from csv
// s: sym or list of syms
// st: start time
// et: end time
```


- Example call:
```q 
calcVWAP[fx;`USDEUR;11:30:00;12:00:00]
calcVWAP[fx;`CADUSD`SGDUSD;11:00:00;12:00:00]

// inspect table fx for appropriate sym and time range parameters for any other calls
```
- Returns a 2 column table of `sym` and `VWAP` values
- Catches and prints error if encountered

TWAP

- Function call format:
```q 
calcTWAP[fx;s;st;et]

// fx: the name of the pre-loaded table from csv
// s: sym or list of syms
// st: start time
// et: end time
```


- Example call:
```q 
calcTWAP[fx;`USDEUR;11:30:00;12:00:00]
calcTWAP[fx;`CADUSD`SGDUSD;11:00:00;12:00:00]

// inspect table fx for appropriate sym and time range parameters for any other calls
```
- Returns a 2 column table of `sym` and `TWAP` values
- Catches and prints error if encountered

#### Task 2 Execution

Conditional VWAP

- Function call format:
```q 
calcCondVWAP[clientorders;markettrades]

// clientorders:  the name of the pre-loaded table from csv
// markettrades:  the name of the pre-loaded table from csv
```


- Example call:
```q 
calcCondVWAP[clientorders;markettrades]
```
- Returns a 4 column table of `sym`, `start`, `end` and `condVWAP` values
- Catches and prints error if encountered


### Unit Tests

#### Starting The q Process
Start up the q process and load in the unit testing script:

```bash
q ~/HSBC/unitTests/k4unit.q
```

Run the following to load in the tests:
```q 
KUltf `$":~/HSBC/unitTests/tests.csv"
```

Run the following to inspect the tests:
```q 
KUT
```

To execute the tests, run following:
```q 
KUrt[]
```

To inspect results: 
```q 
KUTR

// or some other examples:
show select from KUTR where not ok
show select from KUTR where not okms
show select count i by ok,okms,action from KUTR
show select count i by ok,okms,action,file from KUTR
```

Running the following saves the table KUtr to a file KUTR.csv:
```q 
KUstr[] 
```
